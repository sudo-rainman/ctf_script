#Feb. 10 â€” Dating Show
##Challenge Description

I'm going on a dating show called Big Friendly Valentine! As you know, though, I already have a Valentine! So Alex will go on the show too! Of course, this is all completely secret and Alex and I will need to be discreet about matching every time. Notes:

    The show consists of 10 rounds.
    I go on blind dates with 7 participants (numbered 0-6). After a round, some subset of the participants will attempt to match with me, and I will have to pick exactly 4 participants to attempt to match with.
    Using some fancy cryptography, I'll figure out exactly who in my list of matches also matched with me. If a participant and I both attempt to match with each other, we have to go on another date!
    Alex will always match with me, and can make sure that no participant with a smaller number matches with me. (In particular, this means that of the set of people who match with me, the one with the smallest index will always be Alex). Help me make sure I don't accidentally end up going on another date with someone other than my valentine!
    The attached "client.py" file contains code to connect to the game server as well as to implement the private set intersection protocol used in this challenge.
