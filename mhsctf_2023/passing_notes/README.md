#Feb. 6 â€” Passing Notes 
##Challenge Description

Passing secret notes? That practically screams Valentine's Day to me! So, I've devised a super-secure way to encrypt a message so you can send it to that special someone! I used my program to encrypt a Valentine just for you! The only thing is... I don't remember the key. Ah, whatever! Here you go: V4m\GDMHaDM3WKy6tACXaEuXumQgtJufGEyXTAtIuDm5GEHS

The valentine{...} wrapper is included in the encrypted text.
