#Feb. 7 â€” Better Notes
##Challenge Description

Okay, so maybe my super-secure method was a bust. But I'm persistent (actually, I'm Sam)! I've written another program, and this time, there aren't any pesky keys to keep (KEYp ðŸ™ƒ) track of! I wrote you another Valentine that my program encrypts as WU]Wipuk\cYAvtEXHsRlP_YlPs[UMtVmkcOjupFCVGU.

The valentine{...} wrapper is included in the encrypted text.
